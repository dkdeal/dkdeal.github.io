Hi, my name is D. K. Deal. About me pages are the hardest to write for me, but I am going to give it my best shot.

I am a developer and aspiring businessman. I am working on starting <a href="https://wellspringapps.io">Wellspring Apps</a>, a software development company. I have just left a job teaching others how to code to jump in the trenches of software development. I recently have been hired by <a href="https://five-startech.com/">Five Star Technology Solutions</a> as a Software Developer. 

This blog is to serve as a place that I can share my experiences in coding, productivity, and business. I hope to share my jounrey into these three areas. Signup for the blog below to keep up with whats going on here on the blog and follow on social media (@dkdeal) for day to day life.
